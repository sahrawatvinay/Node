1. Closures : Closure is a powerful concept in JavaScript that allows a function to retain access to its lexical scope, even after the function has finished executing. 
	In simpler terms, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function, even after the outer function has returned.
	function outerFunction() {
		let outerVariable = 'I am from outer function';
		function innerFunction() {
			console.log(outerVariable);
		}
		return innerFunction;
	}
	const myClosure = outerFunction(); // outerFunction() returns innerFunction
	myClosure(); // "I am from outer function"
	
2. Hoisting :
	Hoisting moves variable and function declarations to the top of their scope during compilation.
	var declarations are hoisted and initialized with undefined.
	Function declarations are fully hoisted, so you can call them before they are defined.
	let and const declarations are hoisted but not initialized, leading to a temporal dead zone.
	
3. Variable typing : type of variable used to store a no. and that same variable is used to store string

4. call, apply and bind in JavaScript
	call and apply are methods that let you call a function with a specific this context and pass arguments.
	function greet(greeting) {
		console.log(greeting + ', ' + this.name);
	}
	const person = { name: 'John' };
	greet.call(person, 'Hello'); // Output: "Hello, John"
	call Method
	Purpose: Calls a function with a given this value and arguments provided individually.
	Syntax: functionName.call(thisArg, arg1, arg2, ...)
	
	function greet(greeting) {
		console.log(greeting + ', ' + this.name);
	}
	const person = { name: 'John' };
	greet.apply(person, ['Hello']); // Output: "Hello, John"
	apply Method
	Purpose: Calls a function with a given this value and arguments provided as an array.
	Syntax: functionName.apply(thisArg, [arg1, arg2, ...])

	function greet(greeting, punctuation) {
    console.log(greeting + ', ' + this.name + punctuation);
	}
	const person = { name: 'Vinay' };
	const greetVinay = greet.bind(person, 'Hello');
	greetVinay('!'); // "Hello, Vinay!"
	When you want to create a new function with a specific this context that can be called later with optional arguments.
	
5. A first-order function is a basic function that does not take other functions as arguments and does not return a function.

6. A higher-order function is a function that either:
	Takes one or more functions as arguments, or
	Returns a function as its result.

7. Temporal dead zone : 
	The Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) is the period between the entering of the scope (block, function, etc.) and the actual declaration of a let or const variable. 
	During this time, the variable is in an uninitialized state and cannot be accessed, leading to a ReferenceError if you try to use it.

	slice() creates a new array by extracting a portion of the original array, without modifying the original.
	splice() modifies the original array by removing, replacing, or adding elements.
	
	let fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date'];
	// Slice from index 1 to 3 (not inclusive)
	let slicedFruits = fruits.slice(1, 3);
	console.log(slicedFruits); // Output: ['banana', 'cherry']
	console.log(fruits);       // Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date']  (original array unchanged)

	let fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date'];
	// Remove 2 elements starting from index 1
	let splicedFruits = fruits.splice(1, 2);
	console.log(splicedFruits); // Output: ['banana', 'cherry'] (removed elements)
	console.log(fruits);        // Output: ['apple', 'date']    (original array modified)
